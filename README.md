# Gitlab Wrapper

Java Gitlab Wrapper is a wrapper for [Gitlab's REST API](https://gitlab.org) written 
written in Java.  This work is a rewrite of the [java-gitlab-api](https://github.com/timols/java-gitlab-api).
You may wish to consider that project for its maven support and overall 
popularity.  This library has been rewritten  to support Java 1.8 only 
features.
